##Magento 2 Module/test- Weather API implementation

This is a simple module in magento 2, I used to learn more about the features of magento 2 modules and working with Api inside magento2.

###Installation:

Clone the repository or install via composer. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api and get your Api keys and change it in Mateus/Novo/Model/Weather.php (//YOUR API KEY HERE). Change the city for your desired city (London as default).

###Information:

Please do not expect any help or bug fixing from me, this is only a trial module for learning proposes. I'm always open for tips or improvements in my code.
